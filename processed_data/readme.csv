Special Thanks <3
"A huge THANK YOU to Ninji for all their work on reverse-engineering the ACNH code!! Their BCSV parsing code was a huge boost in our ability to verify and add data straight from the game files to this spreadsheet, and it wouldn't have grown the way it has without that.

You can find their Twitter here: https://twitter.com/_Ninji
and their ACNH Ghidra & parsing scripts here: https://github.com/Treeki/CylindricalEarth"
